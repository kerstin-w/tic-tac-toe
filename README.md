# Tic Tac Toe - Game

# Introduction

Tic Tac Toe is a game built as Portfolio Project 3 for Code Institute Full-stack development course. It utilises pure Python3 and a collection of libraries to expand on the functionality of the project. The game runs in the Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku. The main goal of the game is to place three of the marks in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal row.

### <a name="logo-menu">Logo and Menu</a>

![Logo](assets/readme/welcome.png "Logo")

When the user enters the website, they see the logo of the game. The user is asked if they want to see the leaderboard or start the game. 

### <a name="leaderboard">Leaderboard</a>

![Leaderboard](assets/readme/leaderboard1.png "Leaderboard")

When the user decides to see the leaderboard, the top 15 scores are displayed. After that the user will be asked again if they want to play the game or end it. 

### <a name="rules">Game Rules</a>

![Game Rules](assets/readme/welcome.png "Game Rules")

When the user decides to play the game, the first thing they see is the rules for playing the game.

### <a name="computer-friend">Choose to play against computer/friend</a>

![Choose Player](assets/readme/player.png "Choose Player")

The user has the option to play the game against the computer. The computer will then make random moves. Alternatively, the user can play against a friend.

### <a name="first-player">First Player</a>

![First Player](assets/readme/first-player.png "First Player")

The user is shown who is playing which symbol and a random first player for the first move is generated. 

### <a name="game-move">Game Move</a>

![Game Move](assets/readme/move.png "Game Move")

The players are asked in turn to enter their move and it is placed on the field. 

### <a name="round-win">Round Win</a>

![Round Win/Tie](assets/readme/round-win.png "Round Win/Tie")

When a player has won the round, this is displayed. Also a draw will be shown after there is no move left.

### <a name="round-win">Round Win</a>

![Score](assets/readme/score.png "Score")

After a round is finished, the score is updated and displayed. After that a new round starts.

### <a name="game-over">Game Over</a>

![Game Over](assets/readme/game-over.png "Game Over")

After 5 rounds are played, the game ends, displays the score and the winner. The winner can then save his score in the leaderboard.

### <a name="updated-leaderboard">Updated Leaderboard</a>

![Leaderboard](assets/readme/leaderboard2.png "Leaderboard")

After the winner has entered his name the leaderboard will be updated and the best 15 players will be listed.

### <a name="future-features">Future Features</a>

#### Smarter Computers moves:

I would like to improve the computer's random moves. First the computer should choose a move that leads to a win. If no move is currently leading to a win, then the computer should choose a move that blocks the user's win. If there is no move to be blocked, the computer should make a random move. 

#### Advanced version of the game:

To make the game a bit more challenging, I would like to include mathematics. The player must not only have three symbols in a row, column or diagonally. Instead of the symbols, the player can use numbers from 1-9. The numbers of a player in a row, column or diagonal must then sum up 15. 


## <a name="storage">Storage Data</a>

---

I have used a Google sheet to save the player name, score and date. The sheet is connected to the code through the Google Drive and the Google Sheet API by the Google Cloud Platform. This enables me to send and receive data as I had access to the Google Sheet API credentials. When deploying the project to Heroku, I added in the Config Vars to the credentials. As this is sensitive data, I also had to add the creds.json in the Git ignore file. This would ensure that these credentials are not pushed to the repository.

### Creating Sheets

- Navigate to [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/).
- Create a Blank sheet.  
- Edit the sheet name.
- The name used must match the name called in the `open()` method.
- Input data if required.
- The `gspread` package allows many operations including retrieving, updating
  and adding new data.

### API Credentials

To enable access from the project to Google Sheets, credentials must be created and provided.

- Navigate to the [Google Cloud Platform](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
- Click "Select a project"
- Click "New Project".
- Enter the project name.
- Click "Create"
- From the project dashboard, select "APIs and services" and then "Library"
- Search for Google Drive API and enable it.
- Click "Create Credentials".-
- Select "Google Drive API" from the drop down list.
- Select "Application data" from the first set of radio buttons.
- Select "No, I', not using them" from the second set of radio buttons.
- Click "Done" and afterwards enter name and describtion for the service account details.
- Select a role of "Editor" from the options available.
- Click "Done" to create the service account.
- Click on the newly created service account on the credentials page.
- Select "Keys" from the top menu bar.
- Select "Create new key" from the "Add Key" menu.
- Select "JSON" and click "Create"
- The JSON file will be downloaded to your computer. Copy the contents into a creds.json file within the repository. Make sure to add this file to the .gitignore file as this is sensitive data.

### <a name="ux-testing">User Experience Testing</a>

#### User Stories

- As a user, I want to understand the purpose of the game.

  _This was achieved by displaying the rules at the beginning of the game._

- As a user, I want to be able to play the game either against a friend or the computer.

  _At the beginning of the game the user has the option to play against the computer or against a friend._

- As a user, I want to be able follow the score after each round.

  _After the end of each round, the updated score is displayed to the user._

- As a user, I want to be able to store my result and see other players' results on the Leaderboard.

  _This was achieved through the API connection with Google Sheets, in which the winner can save their score and the top 15 score is displayed._

#### Site Owner Goals

- As a developer, I want to build an easy game for the user to play.

  _The game is familiar to all the people of the world since childhood and the user is guided throughout the game confidently._

- As a developer, I want usernames, final scores and date to be uploaded to Google Spreadsheets.

  _This was achieved through the API connection with Google Sheets, in which the winner can save their score and the top 15 score is displayed._

- As a developer, I want the user to be warned if they input invalid data or provide an incorrect answer.

  _All inputs are validated and if the input does not match the selection options, the user is asked to re-enter the input._

### <a name="Bugs">Bugs</a>

### Fixed Bugs

- Multiple calls for game_over function:

  The way the code was originally structured, the `game_over` function was called multiple times, which resulted in the user being asked to enter his name multiple times to save the final score. I changed the reset_game function and added an if statement which checks if the five rounds have been completed and then calls the `game_over` function.

- Styling Heroku:

  I tried to change the appearance of the Heroku app with CSS to display the terminal centrally. Therefore I wrapped the body in a Div and used flexbox, which in the end disrupted the entire styling. After taking a closer look at the class selector, I could determine that by using `margin: 0 auto` on `xterm-screen` and `xterm-viewport` the terminal could be centralized.

### Unsolved Bugs

- Clear Termin:

In Gitpod my function to clear the terminal had worked wonderfully where in Heroku only the latest lines were cleared. I have tried several [variations](https://github.com/kerstin-w/tic-tac-toe/commit/ab5b63b36911f9a1cf5b1880819cc001690b3363) (found on [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/clear-screen-python/) and [DelfStack](https://www.delftstack.com/howto/python/python-clear-console/#use-the-os-module-to-clear-interpreter-console-in-python)) of this function. 
I removed the function from the `class Board` into `game_extras.py` as I thought it might be a problem that this function was called in the class. 
Then I deleted the function and accessed `os.system('clear')` directly. I thought according to the KISS principle, calling another function is taking alonger way and this might be the solution.
Unfortunately, none of my efforts led to the desired result. Since this is not an essential feature, I decided to remove this function, if it does not work 100% well.
